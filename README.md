Git clone the repo:
	git clone  &&
 cd Notify

To install dependencies:
	npm install

Build is already in the repo, but just in case you need to rebuild:
	npm run build

To launch server:
	npm start

Go to http://localhost:8080
Once you've submited your username, the notifcation page will load, and you'll
be connected to a room/channel.
You can send a notification/message to your/another room.

Also you can use the command:
	npm run notify [room] [message]

But you'd need to be on another terminal.
